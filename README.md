# RetailDet
Coming soon...
# Purpose
Our team's research direction: We aim to design a neural network model to construct a high-performance object detector, which is tailored for retail scenarios characterized by high-density distribution and diverse scales. This detector features low-latency inference and can be deployed on edge computing devices. Addressing the bottlenecks in existing YOLO-series models, such as insufficient capability to handle scenarios with high-density distribution and diverse scales, as well as suboptimal inference efficiency at the edge, we focus on researching lightweight architecture design and efficient feature extraction techniques. Our goal is to achieve collaborative optimization of detection accuracy and inference speed, creating a new-generation object detection solution that balances high precision and real-time performance. We welcome all interested researchers to get in touch with us, and let us work together to research intelligent new retail.
